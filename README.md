# ðŸ“˜ MMIT Mini Project Report

Welcome to the repository for the **MMIT (Modern Methods of Information Technology) Mini Project**. 
  This project report outlines the objectives, methodologies, tools, and conclusions of the mini project undertaken as part of the academic curriculum.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

The "Door Lock System using Keil Software" is a comprehensive project that involves the development of a secure and interactive door locking mechanism through the integration of an ARM-based microcontroller and the utilization of KEIL uVISION 5software. 
The project not only offers a practical solution for controlling access to a simulated door but also serves as an educational platform for embedded system development.
The core of the system lies in the software code, which is designed to manage user input via a keypad and control the position of a servo motor to lock or unlock the door. 
Keil MDK is employed for writing, simulating, and debugging the firmware to ensure the system's functionality and reliability.
The hardware components are integrated and interfaced with the microcontroller, transforming code into physical actions. 
A keypad provides an input mechanism for users to enter authentication credentials, while a servo motor replicates the real-world locking and unlocking of a door. 
The system can be further expanded by introducing additional security features, such as user management, password protection, or remote access via wireless communication protocols
